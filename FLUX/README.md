# FLUX (Forecasting Liquidity Using eXternal signals)

FLUX is a data-driven simulation engine designed to model and forecast the short-term behavior of commodity marketsâ€”starting with oil. By leveraging external macroeconomic signals such as currency strength, geopolitical risk, and inventory levels, FLUX goes beyond traditional static models to capture real-world market dynamics. It combines Monte Carlo simulation with adaptive volatility modeling to provide probabilistic insights into price trajectories, enabling better risk assessment, scenario planning, and decision-making for traders, analysts, and energy sector stakeholders.
